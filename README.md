# Crop-Yield-Prediction-
Our team has used Machine Learning(ML) Models and Web  Development to deal with the problem that farmers face regarding the  loss of crops due to diseases. We plan to take data in conjunction with  the the data provided by the meteorological department. We will use  that data to understand climatic conditions and crop's dependence on  it in a region and then make use of that data to predict crop yield,  rainfall, and fertilizer usage. These predictions can help farmers prepare  for the future This can help farmers take precautions like using required organic and  inorganic compounds like fertilizers, pesticides etc, beforehand to  decrease the loss of crops, or even resort to availing crop insurance. To  implement the above proposed solution, we have used ARIMA ML  model.
